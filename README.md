## Instruction

  - Clone this project
  - Relative path to App.js in the console run 'npm install'

- Execution
  - Place all images in the **_images_** folder
  - Relative path to App.js, in the console run 'npm start'

* NOTE: Added CLI input, run with the target folder as command line argument.
* TODO: automatically create a new folder to export files into, create as sibling to the target folder
That's it!

>>NOTE: Setup only done once. If you want to batch process a set of images again, all you need to do is the execution part. Delete the file .gitkeep in the folders **images** and **webp-coverted**, only reason why there is a file .gitkeep in there so that i can push an empty folder. 
### TODO NEW FEATURE  (ashlyn)
* Command line argument input directory
* Autocreates output directory

>>NOTE: Setup only done once. If you want to batch process a set of images again, all you need to do is the execution part.
