# Convert any images to webP image in batch.
---

### Instruction

- Setup
  - Clone this project
  - Relative path to App.js in the console run 'npm install'

- Execution
  - Place all images in the **_images_** folder
  - Relative path to App.js, in the console run 'npm start'

That's it!

>>NOTE: Setup only done once. If you want to batch process a set of images again, all you need to do is the execution part. Delete the file .gitkeep in the folders **images** and **webp-coverted**, only reason why there is a file .gitkeep in there so that i can push an empty folder.
